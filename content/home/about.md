Understanding the mechanism underlying the experience of pain and affect is essential in society, and is the basis of an effective healthcare system. Unlike most medical conditions, which are diagnosed on the basis of reliable biomarkers or radiological imaging, pain is an experience that is difficult to quantify objectively, and is mainly assessed using self-reports and indirect information about its presence. It is therefore not surprising (but still highly problematic), that pain is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated, even in specialized medical institutions.

The main objective of this research group is to study, with a multidisciplinary approach, the cognitive processes underlying the experience of pain and affect, in order to shed light to the processes that might improve pain management, and improve the performance of doctors/nurses in hospital settings.
