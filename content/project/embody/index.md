Embodied models of social cognition argue that representations of first-hand sensorimotor experiences (such as physical pain) are re-enacted during the interaction with other people, for instance when we empathize with others' suffering or we witness unfair/ostracizing treatments. The goal of this project is to ascertain whether first-hand experiences influence social behavior through sensory-specific processes or supramodal representations of dimensions such as unpleasantness, which are common to many qualitatively different states.
